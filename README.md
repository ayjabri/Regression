# Introduction
This repository contains IPy notebooks that are mainly educational but also serve as a reference for those solving regression problems on their jobs. 
The notebooks are structured in an easy-to-understand pipeline that takes you step-by-step through the process of solving linear, and non-linear, regressions. Honestly, I keep coming back to them with every new project because of how practical they are. I hope you find them useful too!

# Sections:
The repo is organized by function as follows:
 Linear: contains simple and multiple regressions with emphasis on model selection and validation, which includes the required tests for linearity, heteroscedasticity, autocorrelation, and many more.
Non-Linear:  under construction
NN: Regression using neural networks. A good starting point to understand neural networks if you come from a traditional data-science background
